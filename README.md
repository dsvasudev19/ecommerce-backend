# E-commerce Backend Development

This document serves as a guide to set up and understand the backend development process for an e-commerce platform using Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, and Sequelize ORM. The backend system includes features such as user authentication, system management, payment integration, and administrative functionalities.

## Technologies Used
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MySQL
- Sequelize ORM

## Setting Up the Environment

### Node.js Installation

### MySQL Installation
Install MySQL from [mysql.com](https://mysql.com) if not already installed.

### Clone the Repository
Clone the backend repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

## Configuration

### Database Setup
1. Create a MySQL database for the project.
2. Configure the database connection in `config/database.js` file.
3. Define the database models using Sequelize ORM in the `models/` directory.

### Environment Variables
1. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory.
2. Define environment variables such as `DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME`, `JWT_SECRET`, etc., in the `.env` file.

## Installation

### Dependencies Installation
Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
